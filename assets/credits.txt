I (Martin) want to thank the following individuals for their great contributions to Infra Arcana:

* Christopher Barrett ("Oryx") - Provided a fantastic and elegant tile set, and even continued to support and maintain the graphics long after the first draft was ready.

* Kornel Dabrowiecki - Contributed countless ideas for gameplay improvements, which are now part of the game. Helped planning and designing the most ambitious version of IA ever released.

* Agata Skrzypczyk  - Provided a gorgeous logo and icon.

* All the people on the IA discussion page, Roguetemple, RPGCodex, Bay12 Games, etc, who give praise and motivation to continue with the project.
